## Recently

**Speaking:** Recently spoke at the British Retail Consortium's Summer School alongside [Erinch Sahan](https://www.doughnuteconomics.org/erinch-sahan) of Doughnut Economics, discussing technology's role in creating sustainable business models.

**Reading:** Currently exploring how transport infrastructure systems can inform digital transformation approaches - there's surprising overlap between building reliable railways and building reliable technology teams.

**Thinking about:** The role of ethical technology leadership in an age of rapid change, and how SMEs can approach digital transformation thoughtfully and sustainably.
