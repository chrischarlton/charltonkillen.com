I help organisations use technology to grow, improve life for colleagues and customers, and create <strong>positive impact on people and planet</strong>.
</div>

Currently Technology Director at [One+All](https://oneandall.org.uk), a certified B Corporation. Previously co-founder of Human, a software development agency where I learned invaluable lessons about leadership, failure, and the real challenges of implementing change.

## What I'm working on

<div class="grid grid-3 margin-top-large">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Agile Made Easy</h3>
    <p>A practical guide to setting up the most valuable in real business environments, beyond the textbook theory. How to make change work when it matters.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Human Failure</h3>
    <p>My forthcoming book about the lessons learned from building and ultimately closing a software development agency. A story of ambition, growth, and valuable failure.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Transforming One+All</h3>
    <p>Profitable, 100% employee-owned and growing year on year. Amazing people doing a great job for their customers but held back by outdated technology. So I'm leading a complete human-first transformation which aims to boost our impact on people and planet.</p>

## Recently

**Speaking:** Spoke at the British Retail Consortium's Summer School alongside [Erinch Sahan](https://www.doughnuteconomics.org/erinch-sahan) of Doughnut Economics, discussing how One+All works as a profitable business to support both the social foundations and ecological boundaries.

**Reading:** Currently exploring how transport infrastructure systems can inform digital transformation approaches - there's surprising overlap between building reliable railways and building reliable technology teams.

**Thinking about:** The role of ethical technology leadership in an age of rapid change, and how SMEs can approach digital transformation thoughtfully and sustainably.
