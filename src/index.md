<div class="lead">
I help organisations use technology to improve life for their colleagues and customers, so that they can both grow and create a <strong>positive impact on people and planet</strong>.
</div>

My main focus today is as Technology Director of [One+All](/experiences/oneandall/), a 100% employee-owned B Corp. I co-founded of [Human](/experiences/human), a software development agency where I learned invaluable lessons about leadership, failure, and the real challenges of implementing change.

## What I'm working on

<div class="grid grid-3 margin-top-large">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Agile Made Easy</h3>
    <p>A practical guide to setting up the minimum viable Agile in real business environments. How to make change work when it matters. Informed by years of project implementation experience.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Human Failure</h3>
    <p>My forthcoming book about the lessons learned from building and ultimately closing a software development agency. A story of ambition, growth, and valuable failure.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Transforming One+All</h3>
    <p>A profitable business which has an incredible social impact. A team of amazing people who look after customers so well, the business keeps growing. But the technology is letting them down. So I'm leading a complete human-first digital transformation which aims to boost scalability as well as social and environmental benefit.</p>

## Recently

**Speaking:** At the British Retail Consortium's Summer School alongside [Erinch Sahan](https://www.doughnuteconomics.org/erinch-sahan) of the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, discussing how One+All works as a profitable business to support both the social foundations and ecological boundaries.

**Reading:** [The Righteous Mind](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/products/righteous-mind-book-jonathan-haidt-9780141039169) by Jonathan Haidt. A fascinating account of evolutionary psycology. How groups are selected for their caracteristics just like individuals and why the left is struggling to connect with voters.

**Thinking about:** How AI is exciting but also has the potential to distracting us from the more basic issues we face in our businesses. So much of the economy remains chronically under transformed, especially public services. AI is not the silver bullet for every problem.
