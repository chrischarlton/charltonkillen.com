Growing good businesses by using technology to <strong>improve the lives of colleagues and customers</strong>.
</div>

My main focus today is my role as Technology Director of [One+All](/experiences/oneandall/), a 100% employee-owned B Corp. I previously co-founded of [Human](/experiences/human), a software development agency where I learned invaluable lessons about leadership, failure, and the real challenges of implementing change.

## What I'm working on

<div class="grid grid-2 margin-top-large">

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Transforming One+All</h3>
    <p>A profitable business making an incredible social impact. A team of amazing people who look after customers so well that the business keeps growing. But legacy technology is letting them down. So I'm leading a complete human-first digital transformation which aims to boost scalability as well as enabling even more social and environmental benefit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Agile Made Easy</h3>
    <p>A practical guide to setting up minimum viable agile in real business environments. Informed by over twenty years of project implementation experience. Helping those who ask for work and those actually doing it to become one team and find their flow together.</p>

## Recently

**Speaking:** At the British Retail Consortium's Summer School alongside [Erinch Sahan](https://www.doughnuteconomics.org/erinch-sahan) of the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, discussing One+All's real world achievements and challenges in relation to the theory.

**Reading:** [The Righteous Mind](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/products/righteous-mind-book-jonathan-haidt-9780141039169) by Jonathan Haidt. A fascinating account of evolutionary psycology. How groups are selected for their caracteristics just like individuals and why the left is struggling to connect with voters.

**Thinking about:** How AI tools probably will change everything, just as happened with the web. But we still need to [start with why](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/products/start-with-why-book-simon-sinek-9780241958223) to make sure we know what we want for the colleagues and customers before we get carried away with the shiny new toys.
