Although as an agile practitioner I believe 'this plan is wrong', I also still think we should have one. When a group starts working together on a project of even slight complexity this exercise is a great way to flush out dependencies and differences in expected approach. This can then enable the right discussions and a good working plan.

Based on the classic [Critical Path Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method) but not as prescriptive about task durations, my approach is just to try and get the shape of it layed out.

1. Working with the whole project group either with post-its or a tool like Miro, ask everyone to brainstorm the tasks they think the project is going to require.
2. Get all the notes organised together in one space and then go through de-duplicating them.
3. Put them into an order with any obvious dependencies coming before other tasks.

After the session, working alone and focused, you can turn this into a diagram with lines to show the actual dependencies. You can then add in any other tasks you know will need to happen such as testing stages, meetings, information from key people.

This artifact can then be shared back with the group, discussed and used as a constant point of reference as the project progresses. You should expect the later stages of the project to keep being updated as things change and new information comes to light.

I find it particularly rewarding to change the colour of the tasks or add checkmarks as they are complete. This then gives a lovely graphical way to update stakeholders on project progress.
