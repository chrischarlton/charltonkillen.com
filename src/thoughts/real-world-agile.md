# Why Most Digital Transformations Fail

After six years leading digital transformation at One+All and the experience of building Human, I've observed a consistent pattern: most technology initiatives fail not because of the technology itself, but because of fundamental misunderstandings about change.

## The Human Element

Technology is never neutral. Every system we build, every process we digitise, every automation we implement has profound effects on the people who use it and the communities it serves.

At One+All, we've learned that successful transformation starts with understanding these human impacts first, then working backwards to the technology solutions.
