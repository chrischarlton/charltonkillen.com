# About Christopher

I'm a strategist and digital transformation leader driven by a deep interest in how people develop ideas, find meaning in their work, and navigate change.

Since 2019, I've been Technology Director at One+All, a certified B Corporation that's profitable, 100% employee-owned, and growing year on year in Greater Manchester. It's a company with exceptional people and values, but when I joined, its technology didn't match its ambition. Helping to close that gap has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my career, and I'm leading a complete human-first transformation aimed at boosting our impact on people and planet.

## Learning from Human

Coming to One+All was also a turning point that prompted me to reflect hard on the years I spent running Human, the digital agency I founded in Manchester with four friends in 2010. Over nearly a decade, we worked on transformation and software projects for brilliant organisations. We built good things and made a real difference. But ultimately, we didn't build a business that could last.

That experience taught me some difficult, necessary lessons about leadership: about the importance of structure, sustainability, and creating space for others to succeed. These lessons became the foundation for my forthcoming book, "Human Failure" - a story about learning from valuable mistakes.

## My Approach

A student of management science, with experience in branding and communications, I've always believed that transformation depends on clear thinking, human-centred design, and technology that evolves from real needs, not wishful thinking. I try to bring just enough structure to make progress inevitable, while leaving room for the craft, care, and creativity that make it meaningful.

I'm clearer than ever that digital transformation isn't about tools or trends: it's about people. And it works best when it helps them lead, care, and craft more.

## Beyond Technology

My passion for well-designed systems extends far beyond software. I'm fascinated by transport infrastructure, especially railways, and how these systems can enrich communities. I'm drawn to the work of Margaret Calvert on UK road signage, the clarity of gov.uk's design principles, and brands like the BBC that make complex things beautifully simple.

## Personal

Along with my husband, I'm an adoptive parent and member of the LGBT+ community. These experiences shape my perspective on creating inclusive, supportive environments, whether that's in technology teams or the broader communities we serve.

Having stepped away from social media (believing it often does more harm than good), this website is my way of sharing thoughts and connecting with people interested in ethical technology leadership, real-world agile implementation, and learning from failure.
