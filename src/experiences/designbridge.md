As a Strategist at Design Bridge, I supported brand strategy teams in both London and Amsterdam offices on a long-term contract basis. This role involved helping significant brands discover and articulate their authentic stories through strategic thinking and creative collaboration.

The role involved quite a bit of travel working with clients in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland.

## What I did

Design Bridge is renowned for its strategic approach to brand development, working with major clients to develop compelling brand narratives and visual identities. My work involved:

- Supporting senior strategists on major brand development projects
- Designing and leading collaborative workshops of owners, managers and senior stakeholders
- Conducting in-depth interviews with brand stakeholders and customers
- Field research to understand brands in context
- Developing strategic thinking and brand positioning work
- Collaborating with creative teams to ensure strategic alignment
- Working across multiple markets and cultural contexts

## What I learned

This experience at Design Bridge was formative in understanding how strategic thinking applies to brand development and business transformation. Working with such a respected agency provided insight into:

- The power of authentic brand storytelling
- How strategy and creativity work together
- The importance of cultural context in brand development
- Professional consulting practices and client relationships

## Foundations for the future

The strategic thinking skills developed at Design Bridge became fundamental to my later work. The experience of helping brands "find and tell their stories" directly influenced my approach to business transformation and the importance of authentic organisational culture - lessons that proved invaluable when founding Human and later joining [One+All](/experiences/oneandall/)
