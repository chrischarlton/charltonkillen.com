Human was a software development agency I founded with four friends in 2010. Over almost a decade, we developed and integrated solutions for major clients whilst growing and nurturing a team of effective professionals. We learned a huge amount too - especially about how to use agile methods in an agency setting.

## The journey

Human was founded to tackle transformation challenges for clients using agile methodologies and ensuring high standards of leadership, care and craft in all elements of our work. We focused on developing transformation strategy with clients and their stakeholders, leading creative and effective workshops, and managing technical development.

## Significant Clients & Projects

We scoped, developed and integrated solutions for clients including:

Jaguar Land Rover
Marshalls Plc
The Telegraph
Medem UK
Ear To The Ground
Morris Hargreaves McIntyre
The National Justice Museum
Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums
Impact International

## Team Development

One of my proudest achievements was growing and nurturing a team of effective professionals - our culture was caring and supportive. Over time we developed skills in transformation strategy, built technical expertise, and created a culture of working in partnership with our clients.

## What I Learned

In the end, it was a bit of a rollercoaster. As we got better at what we did, our client work expanded and we grew the business. But we also made some significant mistakes which compounded in the later years and ultimately led to my decision to pursue the orderly closure of the business.

The final three years at Human were starting to teach me invaluable lessons about leadership, failure, and the real challenges of implementing change. The experience of closing the business provided some of the most valuable learning of my career.

## The Lessons Live On

The lessons from Human and the perspectives from my current role have provided a two-way leaning process which reinforces the learning. I've learned that candour, clarity and deciciveness are important ingredients in a caring culture.

I'm massively grateful to my Human co-founders and all the colleagues we worked with along the way. It was an incredible experience which I think I'll continue to reflect on for many years to come.
