I graduated with BSc Management from Manchester Business School. My dissertation title was "How to effect social change towards sustainabilty" a theme that would prove central to my later career choices and values.

## Subject focus

We covered a comprehensive foundation in business principles, but I was particularly drawn to modules connected with:

- Organisational behaviour and change management
- Social responsibility in business
- Strategic thinking and planning
- Leadership and team dynamics

## Extra curricular

University provided opportunities to explore entrepreneurial interests through various startup businesses and involvement in student radio. I found these activities as formative as the academic work, providing early experience in:

- Team leadership and collaboration
- Project management under pressure
- Creative problem-solving
- Understanding audience and stakeholder needs

## How to effect change towards sustainability?

My dissertation reviewed theories of social change in an attempt to unpack the mechanics through which we could move society in the direction of action on climate change.

Ultimately I found that the inherent complexity of sustainability challenges cause us to outsource our understanding of the issue and that there could be no fixed answers better than committing to continuous thought, reflection and action on living within the ecological bounds of the planet. 

It stands up well in many ways, but is naive in one crucial aspect. I thought the worst we could face was apathy. Writing this in 2025 it's apparent that even this was optimistic, as climate denial and the popularisation of anti-net-zero policies has taken hold.

## Foundations

The combination of academic rigour, entrepreneurial experimentation, and focus on sustainable business practices established the intellectual framework that would guide my later decisions - from founding Human with its focus on craft and care, to joining One+All with its authentic commitment to people and planet. The experience also built on the more practical perspective I'd started to develop in my [gap year job at LiverpoolFC.tv](/experiences/lfctv/).
