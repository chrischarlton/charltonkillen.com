I graduated with BSc Management from Manchester Business School. My dissertation title was "How to effect social change towards sustainabilty" a theme that would prove central to my later career choices and values.

## Subject focus

We covered a comprehensive foundation in business principles, but I was particularly drawn to modules connected with:

- Organisational behaviour and change management
- Social responsibility in business
- Strategic thinking and planning
- Leadership and team dynamics

## Extra curricular

University provided opportunities to explore entrepreneurial interests through various startup businesses and involvement in student radio. I found these activities as formative as the academic work, providing early experience in:

- Team leadership and collaboration
- Project management under pressure
- Creative problem-solving
- Understanding audience and stakeholder needs

## Dissertation: Social Change and Sustainability

My dissertation explored the intersection of business practice and social responsibility. Crucially it explored a question which I still think is unanswered, how do we build the political will for the scale of the social change and buy in needed to stave off disaster from climate change? Some of my research examined how businesses can be forces for positive change rather than just profit extraction.

## Foundations

The combination of academic rigour, entrepreneurial experimentation, and focus on sustainable business practices established the intellectual framework that would guide my later decisions - from founding Human with its focus on craft and care, to joining One+All with its authentic commitment to people and planet. The experience also built on the more practical perspective I'd started to develop in my [gap year job at LiverpoolFC.tv](/experiences/lfctv/).
