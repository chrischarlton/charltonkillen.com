## Role Summary

As Technology Director at One+All, I lead the complete digital transformation of a 100% employee-owned B Corporation. My role combines hands-on technology leadership with board-level strategic responsibility, overseeing both the maintenance of existing systems and the implementation of modern replacements that support the company's growth and values.

## How I Joined One+All

One+All was one of Human's final clients before we closed the agency. During a scoping project to explore software solutions for buying and forecasting, I was deeply impressed by the company's culture and authentic commitment to doing right by people and planet. 

It's hard to describe, but in all my experience of going into different businesses, I'd never found one where the values on the walls were practised so authentically. I described it to friends as 'the real deal' - a decent team of people doing right by each other, the people in the supply chain, and the planet. The fact that it's 100% employee-owned means everyone has a stake in its success with no one trying to extract cash for the sake of it.

When Human closed, we reconnected. I initially supported One+All as a board advisor before taking on the Technology Director role in summer 2019.

## The Challenge I Inherited

The business needed serious help with technology. Here was a brilliant team doing great work for customers in spite of their systems, not aided by them. The legacy ERP had a difficult user interface, was built on a little-known framework with a small development team, and had no API connectivity, making any integration very challenging.

## My Approach

I started with a full audit of the technology and operations situation, writing a Technology Strategy that set out what we wanted to achieve and the principles we would work to. This strategy gets tweaked and updated as we make progress, but the essence remains the same today and continues to guide our transformation work six years later.

## Key Responsibilities

**Technology Leadership:**
- Leading the Technology Team whose responsibilities split between maintaining existing systems and building their replacements
- Running agile implementation projects with in-house development, specialist web agencies, and software vendors

**Strategic Leadership:**
- Board director responsibilities including overall business leadership, strategy, and governance
- Continuous refinement of our technology strategy to align with business growth

## Major Projects & Achievements

### Slack and Google Workspace Implementation
An important foundation project was getting everyone collaborating using decent real-time tools rather than disjointed MS Office files and email. We got everyone onboarded to these online tools just in time for them to facilitate the flexibility we needed during the pandemic when, for the first time ever, many colleagues needed to work from home.

### My Account Platform
For our wholesale customers, My Account is an online ordering platform providing access to product information and the ability to place and follow up on orders. Customers can order plain, print, and embroidered products as day-to-day or forward orders.

**Impact:** Since launching in 2021, the platform has grown consistently and now regularly accounts for 40% of order handling. This has beneficially impacted the Customer Care team whilst allowing production to be easier to plan since demand information has become more real-time.

### Customer API
Creating a fully documented RESTful API enables customers to connect their websites and back-end systems to us for product information lookups and seamless purchase ordering. Live since Spring 2025.

### The Making Of - New Brand Website
Launching a new sales channel for new customers whilst building new services to facilitate data integration as part of an 'Ecosystem' approach to replacing the legacy ERP. This project involves implementing new third-party systems and modelling the systems the rest of the business will move to once they're proven.

## Measurable Impact

The transformation has delivered significant efficiency improvements. The My Account platform alone has allowed the same size Customer Care team to handle incoming sales that have grown by 60%. As the team leader puts it: "It's like having several extra colleagues working with me."

## What This Role Means to Me

Working at One+All represents the convergence of my technical expertise with my values. It's rare to find an organisation where doing the right thing for people and planet isn't just marketing speak, but genuine operational practice. Leading technology transformation in this context has taught me how powerful authentic culture can be in driving successful change.

The employee ownership model creates a unique dynamic where technology decisions are made for long-term sustainability rather than short-term extraction, allowing us to build systems that truly serve the business and its stakeholders.
